This repository contains the code for plotting and clustering the coordinates of pin codes of Delhi using the K-Means Clustering Algorithm. The code for K-Means Algorithm is 
written from scratch using NumPy functions. The values of K are taken to be from 2 to 10 and corresponding cluster plots are plotted. The inertias (sum of distances squared) 
are also plotted for each K and the appropriate value of K is determined. Based on the most appropriate K value, the clusters are analysed from geographic, socio-economic and 
development points of view.
